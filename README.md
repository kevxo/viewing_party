## About This Project <a name="about_this_project"></a>

Viewing party is an application in which users can explore movies, add friends, and create parties to watch movies together! Users can search for a specific movie or they can explore a list of the current top movies. A user can click on a chosen movie's title to be taken to a details page to learn more about that movie including information about the runtime, genre, cast members, and reviews. 

Once a user has chosen a movie, and selected friend's they would like to invite, the user can create a viewing party on a given date, at a specific start time, and for a given duration!
